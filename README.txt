* exabis student review Block - Description *

The main focus of this block is a periodical review of students by more teachers. The basic idea of this module (acknowledging all new features of the moodle gradebook) is that teachers do not always have time during the year to give solid feedback to the students but
seek a simple way to do this periodically – for example at the end of each school-semester. The feedback can be seen as an additional information that are given to the students where students are assessed by a teacher-team.
If Exabis Competence Grid block is also installed, assessment-categories can be made available from there. Students can print out their review at any time in the pdf-format.

* exabis student review Block - Disclaimer *

As with any customization, it is recommended that you have a good backup of your Moodle site before attempting to install contributed code.
While those contributing code make every effort to provide the best code that they can, using contributed code nevertheless entails a certain degree of risk as contributed code is not as carefully reviewed and/or tested as the Moodle core code.
Hence, use this block at your own risk.

* exabis student review Block - History *

Using the pedagogical method of cooperative open learning (COOL) a culture of reflectiveness plays an important part - this module emphasizes on this aspect. It was the first module produced for this method. See more at http://www.cooltrainers.at/index.php?id=150&L=1
In addition to the „verbal“ review, teachers can rate their students on a 10-point-scale regarding teamwork, responsibility and self-reliability. An average point‐rate from all teachers is aggregated and printed out on the student review report card for each individual student.
